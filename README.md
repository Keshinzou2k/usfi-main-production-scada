## üìã Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+)
- Web server for deployment (optional for local use)
- No database required (uses in-memory storage)

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Direct File Access
```bash
# Clone or download the project
git clone <repository-url>
cd advanced-production-control

# Open the HTML file in your browser
open advance-production-control.html
```

### Option 2: Local Server
```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Option 3: Production Deployment
1. Upload `advance-production-control.html` to your web server
2. Ensure proper MIME types are configured
3. Access via your domain: `https://yourdomain.com/advance-production-control.html`

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Starting a Production Batch
1. **Select Mixer**: Click on an available mixer (2, 3, or 4)
2. **Confirm Dispensing**: Review recipe details in the confirmation modal
3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time updates in the formulation table
4. **Completion**: System automatically shows results upon completion

### Managing Recipes
- **Priority System**: Recipes with priority 2 are processed first
- **Batch Tracking**: System tracks remaining batches for each recipe
- **Mixer Assignment**: Automatic assignment based on batch size and priority

### Maintenance Features
- **Theme Selection**: Access via Settings ‚Üí Theme
- **Maintenance Requests**: Use the structured form for issue reporting
- **Emergency Stop**: Immediate system shutdown for safety

## üèó System Architecture

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  items: [
    {id: 1, name: "BARLEY", maxWeight: 150},
    // ... 21 more items
  ],
  recipes: [
    {
      id: "WARB7K",
      name: "WARBIRD 7 KINDS",
      priority: 1,
      batches: 8,
      mixer: 4,
      ingredients: [
        {itemId: 1, required: 150},
        // ... recipe components
      ]
    }
    // ... additional recipes
  ]
}
```

### State Management
The application uses a centralized state object (`appState`) that tracks:
- Current production status
- Timer and progress information
- Bin status and servo positions
- Active faults and error states
- Theme preferences

## üîß Configuration

### Theme Customization
The system supports four themes:
- **Dark** (Default): Industrial dark interface
- **Light**: High-contrast light mode
- **Traditional**: Warm, earthy tones
- **Soft**: Pastel color scheme

### Production Parameters
Key configurable parameters:
- Bulk servo position (default: 100%)
- Dribble servo position (default: 25%)
- Stability timeout (default: 30 seconds)
- Overshoot tolerance (default: 2%)

## üìä Formulation Process

### Dispensing Algorithm
1. **Calculate Drops**: `Math.ceil(requiredWeight / binMaxWeight)`
2. **Bulk Phase**: 100% servo opening for rapid filling
3. **Dribble Phase**: 25% servo opening for precision
4. **Stability Check**: Wait for "ST" signal before transfer
5. **Weight Transfer**: Move from weigh bin to actual weight

### Status Indicators
- üü¢ **STANDBY**: Ready for operation
- üîµ **DISPENSING**: Actively dispensing material
- üü° **CALIBRATING**: Waiting for weight stability
- üü£ **DROPPING**: Transferring material
- üîµ **DONE**: Process completed successfully
- üî¥ **OFFLINE**: System or bin unavailable

## üö® Safety Features

### Emergency Systems
- **E-Stop Function**: Immediate shutdown of all operations
- **Fault Detection**: Automatic error identification and logging
- **Safety Interlocks**: Prevents conflicting operations

### Error Handling
- **Overshoot Protection**: Monitors weight exceeding tolerances
- **Stability Timeout**: Prevents infinite waiting for signals
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for minor faults

## üì± Responsive Design

The interface adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full dashboard with side-by-side panels
- **Tablet**: Stacked layout with optimized touch targets
- **Mobile**: Single-column design with larger controls

## üîÑ API & Integration

While currently a standalone application, the architecture supports future integration:
